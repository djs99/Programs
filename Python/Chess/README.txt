The Programs have been written to find the solutions using back tracking, greedy and dynamic programming approach.
The initial commit contains only 2 programs
1. N Queens problem: A solution for finding all the possible ways in which N Queens can be placed on an N x N board such that no queen sees any other. This was done in three different ways using backtracking, dynamic programming and finally applying a heuristic approach. Out of these backtracking is the slowest one and heuristic takes least amount of time.

2. knights move : A generalised solution for finding the minimum number of steps a kinght should take in order to reach from point A to B in a chess board of size N. 

In both the above programs the N can vary. 

The programming language used is python and there is no special library used, no complicated datarstructures are used,
